# AssetLibrary

After searching through Udemy for new courses to learn from I came across Dhruv Govil's Python For Maya: Artist Friendly Programming course.
I am already familiar with Python but I was curious about the tools he talked about and I really liked his controllerLibrary.
The use of screenshots and a QListWidget made the tool seem more approachable than tools I have made before in Maya.

This repo, while not a branch from his repo located here https://github.com/dgovil/PythonForMayaSamples, will serve as my expansion on the tool he taught in the course.
It will also include other topics that Govil goes over.
